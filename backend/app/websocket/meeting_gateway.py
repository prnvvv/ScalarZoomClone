"""Narrow adapter over Backend Developer 1's meeting domain.

The realtime layer must never duplicate meeting validation or meeting-ending
database logic. Every call into BD1's ``Meeting`` model and
``meeting_service`` is funnelled through this single module so the integration
surface stays easy to review and change in one place.

BD1 surface this depends on (verified against ``app.models.meeting``):

    class Meeting(Base)
        id: int                    # internal primary key, used by participant FKs
        meeting_id: str            # PUBLIC id, e.g. "839452761" (never a foreign key)
        host_id: int               # authoritative host identity -> users.id
        status: MeetingStatus      # scheduled | active | ended | cancelled

    app.services.meeting_service.end_meeting(db, meeting) -> Meeting | None

The WebSocket endpoint is keyed by the public ``meeting_id`` string, so every
lookup here queries by that column rather than by primary key.
