# Scalar Zoom Clone — Backend

FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.x + SQLite backend for the video conferencing platform.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

`requirements.txt` is the single source of truth for backend dependencies and is
what CI installs. Do not duplicate the list in `pyproject.toml`.

## Run

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The SQLite schema and the demo user are created automatically on startup, so a
fresh database needs no extra step. The database file lives at
`backend/data/zoom_clone.db`; relative `DATABASE_URL` paths are resolved against
`backend/`, so the location does not depend on the working directory.

Interactive API docs: <http://localhost:8000/docs>

## Seed sample data (optional)

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.seed.seed_data
```

Idempotent: repeat runs create no duplicates. Inserts the demo user plus a small
deterministic set of meetings (one ended with attendees, one live, one scheduled).

## Environment

Copy `backend/.env.example` and export the values; see that file for the
supported variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `STUN_SERVER`, `APP_NAME`).

## Tests

```bash
cd backend
pytest                    # whole backend suite
pytest tests/test_meetings.py -v
```

Tests use their own temporary SQLite databases and never touch
`backend/data/zoom_clone.db`.

## REST API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/users/me` | current (demo) user |
| POST | `/api/meetings` | create an instant, active meeting |
| GET | `/api/meetings/{meeting_id}` | meeting details |
| POST | `/api/meetings/{meeting_id}/join` | join validation |
| DELETE | `/api/meetings/{meeting_id}` | end or cancel a meeting |
| POST | `/api/schedules` | schedule a future meeting |
| GET | `/api/schedules/upcoming` | scheduled meetings, soonest first |
| GET | `/api/schedules/recent` | finished/live meetings, newest first |
| GET | `/api/meetings/{meeting_id}/participants` | participants of a meeting |
| POST | `/api/meetings/{meeting_id}/participants` | add a participant |
| DELETE | `/api/participants/{participant_id}` | mark a participant as left |

`{meeting_id}` is always the **public** nine-digit id, never the internal
primary key.

## WebSocket

`WS /ws/meetings/{meeting_id}` for signaling and participant state. Media is
peer-to-peer via WebRTC; audio/video never passes through FastAPI.
